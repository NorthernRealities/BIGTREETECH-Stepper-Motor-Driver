### Motherboard firmware configuration
 * The firmware of the motherboard only needs to configure the pulse number per millimeter to ensure that it is consistent with the microsteps set in S42C. S42C does not communicate with the motherboard through SPI or UART. Other configurations can be set according to A4988 STANDALONE mode.
